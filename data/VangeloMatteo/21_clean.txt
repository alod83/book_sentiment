 When they be close to Jerusalem and reach Bethphage , towards the Mount of Olives , Jesus send two disciple , say to them : `` Go to the village in front of you and immediately you will find a donkey , tie , and with it a colt .
 Untie them and bring them to me .
 And if someone tell you something , answer : “ The Lord need them , but he will send them back immediately ” » .
 Now this happen in order to fulfill what have be say through the prophet :
 Tell the daughter of Zion :
 Behold , your king come to you ,
 meek , sit on a donkey
 and on a colt , the son of a beast of burden .
 The disciple go and do what Jesus have order them : they bring the donkey and the colt , put their cloak on them and he sit on them .
 The crowd , very large , spread their cloak on the road , while others cut branch from the tree and spread them on the road .
 The crowd that precede him and that which follow him shout :
 « Hosanna to the son of David !
 Blessed be he who come in the name of the Lord !
 Hosanna in the highest of the sky !
 » .
 As he enter Jerusalem , the whole city be agitate and say , `` Who be this ? ''
 And the crowd reply : `` This be the prophet Jesus , from Nazareth of Galilee . ''
 Jesus enter the temple and drive out all those who sell and buy in the temple ; overturn the table of the money changer and the chair of the dove seller and say to them : `` It be write :
 My house will be call a house of prayer .
 Instead you make it a den of thief » .
 The blind and the lame come to him in the temple , and he heal them .
 But the chief priest and scribe , see the wonder he have do and the child cheer in the temple : `` Hosanna to the son of David !
 `` , Were indignant , and say to him , `` Do n't you hear what these be say ? ''
 Jesus answer them : « Yes !
 You have never read :
 From the mouth of child and infant
 have you draw praise for yourself ?
 » .
 He leave them , go out of the city , towards Bethany , and there he spend the night .
 The next morning , as he return to the city , he be hungry .
 Seeing a fig tree along the road , he approach him , but find nothing but leave , and say to him : `` Never again will a fruit be bear of you ! ''
 And immediately the fig wither away .
 Seeing this , the disciple be amaze and say : `` Why do the fig tree wither in an instant ? `` .
 Jesus answer them , `` Truly I tell you , if you have faith and do not doubt , not only will you be able to do what I have do to this tree , but even if you say to this mountain , '' Get up and throw yourself into the sea `` , it will happen .
 .
 And everything you ask with faith in prayer , you will get. ``
 He enter the temple and , while he be teach , the chief priest and the elder of the people come up to him and say , `` By what authority do you do these thing ? ''
 And who give you this authority ?
 » .
 Jesus answer them : `` I too will ask you only one question .
 If you answer me , I too will tell you with what authority I do this .
 Where do John 's baptism come from ?
 From heaven or from men ?
 » .
 They argue among themselves say : `` If we say : 'From heaven ' , he will answer us : 'Why then do you not believe him ? '
 If we say : “ From men ” , we be afraid of the crowd , because everyone considers John a prophet » .
 Answering Jesus they say : `` We do n't know . ''
 Then he too say to them : `` Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these thing . ''
 `` What do you think ?
 A man have two son .
 He turn to the first and say : `` Son , today go to work in the vineyard '' .
 And he reply , `` I do n't feel like it . ''
 But then he repent and go there .
 He turn to the second and say the same .
 And he say , `` Yes , sir . ''
 But he do n't go there .
 Which of the two do the father 's will ?
 » .
 They reply : `` The first . ''
 And Jesus say to them , “ Truly I tell you , tax collector and prostitute pass you along in the kingdom of God .
 For John come to you on the way of righteousness , and you do not believe him ; the tax collector and prostitute , on the other hand , believe him .
 On the contrary , you have see these thing , but then you have not even repent so as to believe him .
 Listen to another parable : there be a man who own land and plant a vineyard there .
 He surround it with a hedge , dig a hole for the press and build a tower .
 He lease it to peasant and go away .
 When the time come to reap the fruit , he send his servant to the peasant to collect the harvest .
 But the peasant take the servant and one beat him , another kill him , another stone him .
 Again he send other servant , more numerous than the first , but they treat them in the same way .
 Finally he send his own son to them say : `` They will have respect for my son ! `` .
 But the peasant , see the son , say among themselves : `` This be the heir .
 Come on , let 's kill him and we will have his inheritance !
 ” .
 They take him , throw him out of the vineyard and kill him .
 So when the owner of the vineyard come , what will he do to those farmer ?
 They say to him , `` Those wicked one , he will make them die miserably and rent out the vineyard to other farmer , who will give him the fruit in due time . ''
 And Jesus say to them , `` Have you never read in the Scriptures :
 The stone that the builder discard
 it have become the cornerstone ;
 this be do by the Lord
 and be it a wonder in our eye ?
 Therefore I tell you , the kingdom of God will be take away from you and give to a people that produce its fruit .
 Whoever fall on this stone will be break ; and he on whom it fall will be crushed. ``
 Upon hear these parable , the chief priest and the Pharisees understood that he be speak of them .
 They try to catch him , but they be afraid of the crowd , because they consider him a prophet .
