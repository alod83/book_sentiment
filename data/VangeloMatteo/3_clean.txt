 In those day John the Baptist come and preach in the Judean desert say : `` Repent , because the kingdom of heaven be near !
 `` .
 For he be the one of whom the prophet Isaiah speak when he say :
 Voice of one cry in the desert :
 Prepare the way of the Lord ,
 straighten its path !
 And he , John , wear a camel-hair dress and a leather belt around his hip ; his food be grasshopper and wild honey .
 Then Jerusalem , all Judea and all the area along the Jordan come to him and be baptize by him in the Jordan River , confess their sin .
 Seeing many Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism , he say to them : « Race of viper !
 Who make you believe you can escape the impend wrath ?
 Therefore bear fruit worthy of conversion , and do not think you can say within yourselves : “ We have Abraham as our father ! ” .
 Because I tell you that from these stone God can raise up child to Abraham .
 The ax be already place at the root of the tree ; therefore every tree that do not bear good fruit be cut down and throw into the fire .
 I baptize you in water for conversion ; but he who come after me be stronger than me and I be not worthy to bring him sandal ; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
 He hold the shovel in his hand and he will clean his yard and gather his wheat in the barn , but he will burn the straw with an unquenchable fire » .
 Then Jesus come from Galilee to the Jordan to John , to be baptize by him .
 But John want to stop him , say : `` Is it I who need to be baptize by you , and be you come to me ? `` .
 But Jesus answer him : `` Leave it for now , because it be fit that we fulfill all righteousness '' .
 Then he let him do it .
 As soon as he be baptize , Jesus come out of the water : and behold , the heaven be open for him and he saw the Spirit of God descend like a dove and come upon him .
 And here be a voice from heaven that say : `` This be my Son , the beloved one : in him I have place my satisfaction '' .
