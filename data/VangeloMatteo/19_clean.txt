 Having finish these talk , Jesus leave Galilee and go to the region of Judea , beyond the Jordan .
 Many people follow him and there he heal them .
 Then some Pharisees approach him to test him and ask him , `` Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason ? ''
 He reply : `` Did you not read that the Creator from the beginning make them male and female and say : For this reason man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife and the two will become one flesh ?
 So they be no longer two , but one flesh .
 Therefore man do not divide what God have join `` .
 They ask him : `` Why then do Moses order to give her the certificate of divorce and to divorce her ? `` .
 He answer them , “ Because of the hardness of your heart , Moses permit you to divorce your wife ; at first , however , this be not the case .
 But I tell you : whoever divorce his wife , except in the case of an illegitimate union , and marries another , commit adultery `` .
 His disciple tell him : `` If this be the situation of a man with respect to a woman , it be not worth get married . ''
 He answer them , 'Not everyone understand this word , but only those to whom it have be grant .
 In fact , there be eunuch who be thus bear from the womb of the mother , and there be others who have be make such by men , and there be still others who have make themselves such for the kingdom of heaven .
 Who can understand , understand » .
 Then child be bring to him to lay his hand on them and pray ; but the disciple rebuke them .
 But Jesus say : « Leave them , do not prevent the child from come to me ; to those who be like them , in fact , the kingdom of heaven belongs » .
 And , have lay his hand on them , he go away from there .
 And behold , a man come up and say to him : `` Teacher , what good must I do to have eternal life ? ''
 He reply , `` Why do you ask me about what be good ? ''
 There be only one good .
 If you want to enter into life , keep the commandment » .
 He ask him : `` Which one ? ''
 Jesus reply : `` You will not kill , you will not commit adultery , you will not steal , you will not testify to falsehood , honor your father and mother and you will love your neighbor as yourself . ''
 The young man say to him , “ All these thing I have observe ; what else be I miss ?
 » .
 Jesus say to him : `` If you want to be perfect , go , sell what you have , give it to the poor and you will have a treasure in heaven ; And Come !
 Follow me ! `` .
 Hearing this word , the young man go away sadly ; indeed he possess many rich .
 Jesus then say to his disciple : « Truly I tell you , it be difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven .
 I repeat : it be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God » .
 At these word the disciple be very amazed and say : `` So who can be save ? `` .
 Jesus look at them and say : `` This be impossible for men , but for God everything be possible . ''
 Then Peter answer him : « Behold , we have leave everything and follow you ; what then will we have of it ?
 » .
 And Jesus say to them , `` Truly I say to you , you who have follow me , when the Son of man be seat on the throne of his glory , at the regeneration of the world , you too will sit on twelve throne to judge the twelve tribe of Israel .
 Anyone who have leave home , or brother , or sister , or father , or mother , or child , or field for my name , will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life .
 Many of the former will be last and many of the latter will be first .
