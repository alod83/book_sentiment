 And while the chief priest and the elder accuse him , he answer nothing .
 Then Pilate say to him , `` Do n't you hear how many testimony they bring against you ? ''
 But he do not answer even a word , so much so that the governor be very surprised .
 At each party , the governor use to release one prisoner of their choice for the crowd .

 Then the governor ask them , `` Of these two , who do you want me to set free for you ? ''
 They answer , `` Barabbas ! ''
 Pilate ask them : `` But then , what shall I do with Jesus , who be call Christ ? `` .
 They all reply : `` Let him be crucify ! ''

 Then he set Barabbas free for them and , after have Jesus scourge , hand him over to be crucify .
 Then the governor 's soldier take Jesus to the praetorium and gather all the troop around him .
 They undress him , make him wear a scarlet cloak , twist a crown of thorn , place it on his head and put a reed in his right hand .
 Then , kneel before him , they mock him : `` Hail , King of the Jews ! ''

 And immediately one of them run to get a sponge , soak it in vinegar , fix it on a reed and give him a drink .
 The others say : « Leave !
 Let 's see if Elias come to save him !

 Pilate say to them , `` You have guard : go and ensure surveillance as you see fit . ''
 They go and , to secure the tomb , they seal the stone and leave the guard there .
